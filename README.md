# Fast Caffee

This is my application is called Fast Coffee, and it allows the user to order fast coffee. You can already see that I have place to order expresso and cortado. If you want to create a new order, you will find a new page and give a order. This order that you gave it will be going to the Web API, connecting to the Web API and placing it in the API which is hosted on Hiroku. All of this application is created using the MVM design pattern. So it not only gets all the orders and displayed it on the screen, it also does the http Post to post a new order.
